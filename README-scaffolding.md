#  Platform Blue Print (Scaffolding) - SPRINT 0

The patterns and best practices mentioned here should be discussed, mitigated and covered (be in place) in any software development cycle before coding begins. This is normally an agenda for SPRINT 0. 

 ## Digital Delivery

```
 Web App
 
 Mobile Web
 
 Mobile Apps
 
 Digital Platforms
 
 Architecting for High Availability / Fault tolerant (Design for failure, Multiple Availability zones, 
 Scaling, Self Healing, Loose Coupling)
 
 Cloud Computing (AWS / AZURE)
 
 Identity Management
 
 Security Architectures
 
 Disaster Recovery
 
 Capacity planning
 
 Performance Management
 
 SOA 
 
 Hosting
 
 Microservices
 
 Integration
 
 Implementation & evolving systems (in which all knowledge workers operate)
 
 Non Functional Requirements
 
 Reporting
 
 Finances
 
 Implementation of Agile delivery practices.
 
 Risk Management
 
 Stakeholder Management
 
 Infrastructure as Code
 
 ```
