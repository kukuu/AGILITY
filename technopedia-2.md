## Difference between a data warehouse and a data lake

The main difference between a data warehouse vs. data lake vs. relational database system is that a relational database is used to store and organize structured data from a single source, such as a transactional system, while data warehouses are built to hold structured data from multiple sources.

### Data lake

The biggest advantage of data lakes is flexibility. By allowing the data to remain in its native format, a far greater—and timelier—stream of data is available for analysis. Some of the benefits of a data lake include: Ability to derive value from unlimited types of data.

### Hadoop data lake

A Hadoop data lake is a data management platform comprising one or more Hadoop clusters. It is used principally to process and store nonrelational data, such as log files, internet clickstream records, sensor data, JSON objects, images and social media posts.

### Big data and Data Lake

 Perhaps the greatest difference between data lakes and data warehouses is the varying structure of raw vs. processed data.

 Raw data is data that has not yet been processed for a purpose. Much associated with Data Lake. Because of this, data lakes typically require much larger storage capacity than data warehouses.

## Benefits of REACT

1. Used for Single Page Applications

2. Better Performance - Businesses that use ReactJS are assured of better performance compared to those that use other frameworks - Avoids 2 way binding - Virtual DOM (DIFFING ALGORITHM). 

Because ReactJS helps to prevent updating of DOM, it means that the apps will be faster and deliver better UX. ReactJS was designed to help improve the total rendered pages from the website server.

  Virtual DOM - Any new view changes are first performed on the virtual DOM, which lives in memory and not on your screen. An efficient algorithm (DIFFING ALGORITHM) then determines the changes made to the virtual DOM to identify the changes that need to be made to the real DOM. It then determines the most effective way to make these changes and then applies only those changes to the real DOM. This guarantees a minimum update time to the real DOM, providing higher performance and a cleaner user experience all around.

3. It's used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. 

4. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

5. Another React js benefits is its ability to deal with a common search engine failure to read JavaScript-heavy apps. As a solution, React can run on the server, rendering and returning the virtual DOM to the browser as a regular webpage.

6. Speed. Fast and is optimised during compilation.

7. Handle errors at run time during compilation.

8. It’s the V in the MVC – the view part

9. Great Developer Tools

 React Developer Tools, available for Chrome and Firefox, is a browser extension for React. It allows you to inspect the React component hierarchies in the virtual DOM. 

10. JSX produces React “elements” and has a number of side benefits, including helping prevent injection attacks.


## What is JSX

 Basically, JSX is a JavaScript render function that helps you insert your HTML right into your JavaScript code.


 What ia BABEL?

 Babel is a JavaScript compiler. Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.


## What are the 5 Scrum ceremonies?

Scrum suggests three roles: The team, ScrumMaster, and product owner; 

four ceremonies: the sprint planning meeting, Daily Scrum, sprint review meeting, and sprint retrospective meeting; 

 three artifacts: the product increment, product backlog, and sprint backlog.


## Principles of Lean Software Development

1. Eliminate Waste.

2. Build Quality In

3. Create Knowledge

4. Defer Commitment

5. Deliver Fast

6. Respect People

7. Optimize the WWole 



## CODE REVIEW


1. Does the code follow SOLID principles

2. Formatting: Where are the spaces and line breaks? Are they using tabs or spaces? How are the curly braces laid out?

3. Style: Are the variables/parameters declared as final? Are method variables defined close to the code where they’re used or at the start of the method?

4. Naming: Do the field/constant/variable/param/class names conform to standards? Are the names overly short?

5. Test coverage: Is there a test for this code?

6. Race conditions

2. What design patterns are used in the new code? Any anti-patterns (in loops etc)


## Attributes of a good leader


1. Honesty and Integrity

2. Creativity and Innovation.

3. Accountability. 

4. Provide Source of INSPIRATION - Inspire Others.

5. Show Commitment and Passion

6. Good Communicator.

7. Have decision-Making Capabilities.

8. Lead by example

9. Delegation and Empowerment. 

10. Clearly defines goals

11. Helps to refine the knowledge base


## ECS and ECR

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. Amazon ECR is integrated with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), simplifying your development to production workflow.


## How to motivate your team

1. Pay your people what they are worth

2. Provide them with a pleasant place to work

3. Offer opportunities for self-development

4. Foster collaboration within the team

5. Encourage happiness

6. Don't punish failure. Help to optimise the process. Training, reconiliation, self development

7. Set clear goals

8. Don't micromanage

9. Avoid useless meetings



## Tracking the metrics / KPI (of the team)

Keeping track of certain metrics is an important step in making sure your company’s software engineering team is performing as efficiently and productively as possible. Here are some of the most essential metrics for developers to track:

1. Lead time

Lead time is a general measurement of the amount of time that passes from product concept to final delivery. 

2. Impact

Impact measures how much changes to the code affect the overall project. It is also a measurement of how those changes impact the engineers who make them. 

3. Churn

Churn is the percentage of time developers spend editing, adding to, or deleting their own code. A high code churn indicates rework and may mean something is wrong in the development process.

4. Productivity

This measures the amount of each engineer’s efficient code, or code that provides business value. An engineer creating a whole new solution or implementing sweeping code changes will likely deal with lots of trial and error with a low efficiency rate. An engineer who is making a lot of small changes with a low churn rate, however, is likely to have a higher efficiency rate.

4. Cycle time

Cycle time, part of lead time, is how long it takes to make a desired change to the software and put it into production. When a team is using DevOps and employing continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices, they can often measure cycle time in minutes rather than months.

5. Open and close rates

The open and close rate is the number of issues or problems developers report and fix or close over a period of time.

6. Down time analysis

Downtime analysis is a measure of the mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to recover/repair (MTTR). This evaluates how well software performs in a production environment.



## HIGH Performing engineering team

The Leader:

1. Drives goal execution and are a catalyst for team performance

2. Sets the bar for performance

3. Sets the tone

4. Communicate goals


The team:

1. People have solid and deep trust in each other and in the team's purpose - they feel free to express feelings and ideas

2. Everybody is working toward the same goals.

2. A quick turn around 

3. Minimum or no down time

3. A good ROI

4. Meeting deadlines, and hiting targets from planning

5. Achieving definition of done,(DoD) over SPRINT period. From requirement gathering to production.

6. Managing low fault levels. Less or minimum  return rates/complaints/bugs from users

7. Accountable for end to end delivery of the products and services. Holding each one responsible.


## SPRINT BURN DOWN CHARTS

The Sprint Burndown Chart makes the work of the Team visible. It is a graphic representation that shows the rate at which work is completed and how much work remains to be done over the SPRINT period. The chart slopes downward over Sprint duration and across Story Points completed.

The outstanding work (or backlog) is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. That is, it is a run chart of outstanding work. It is useful for predicting/forecasting when all of the work will be completed

## SPRINT BURN UP CHARTS

Burn up chart shows how much work has been completed, and the total amount of work.
