# Leadership and Culture

Leadership and culture in organisations refer to the role leadership plays in an organisation's culture. It refers to how leaders interact with one another and their team members. It's the way leaders operate, communicate, and make decisions. And it's about the everyday working environment: their behaviors, interactions, beliefs, and values.

No matter how great a company's organisational culture may be, its objectives and goals may remain unachieved without the influence of good leadership. A leader is anyone who has the authority or ability to influence and motivate others, irrespective of their title. They embody and reinforce the company's visions and set the rules with which the company work.

An organisation's culture comes from the values and practices that guide the decisions of the company. It's a collection of a company's objectives and mission that guides the actions and behaviours of the employer and their employees. Leadership and culture in organisations promote a positive atmosphere in the workplace, improves the performance of employees and can help the general success of the business.

Achieving a company's goals and objectives depends on its leadership and organisational culture. The presence of strong leadership helps employees carry out different activities efficiently and effectively. Understanding how leadership affects organisational culture can influence your company's productivity and how you collaborate with your team members. 

It's also the responsibility of leaders to define the company's ethics and beliefs while teaching the employees how to live by these values. Ethical leaders promote a culture of trust, integrity, honesty and fairness. They work to establish the organisation's core values and show employees what the management expects of them. People in leadership roles influence the organisational culture of the company, positively or negatively.

## Servant Leadership

A Servant Leader is one who helps their teams to perform at their best by ensuring that the business outcomes are clearly understood, allowing the teams to define how they deliver those outcomes within the set guidelines. A Servant Leader should support their  teams by unblocking issues and offering strategic advice and guidance and  balancing delegation and accountability.

## How does leadership influence organisational culture

Leaders can educate employees on the company's organisational culture through their interactions. Both action and inaction go a long way in showing employees which actions and behaviour are acceptable or unacceptable in the company. Below are influences of leadership on culture in organisations:

### It reinforces accountability:

Accountability in the workplace is a major influencer of organisational structure. Leaders often make the rules and policies that guide a company, but holding employees accountable for their actions keeps them responsible and able to perform their tasks effectively. Good leaders build a culture of accountability when they clearly outline the responsibilities of employees and the standards by which they measure their success. Doing this gives employees a clear picture of the results the employers want them to achieve and motivates them to achieve and even exceed these expectations.

### It helps employers understand their roles and skills:

Outstanding leaders help employees to understand their assigned tasks and design a working strategy that allows them to execute their duties effectively. They help employees broaden their knowledge of their responsibilities and help to improve their skill sets. This may require additional training of team members in a particular department or cross-training of employees from different departments to increase their knowledge and strengthen their bonds.

### It fosters effective communication:

To be efficient and productive, it's important that employees understand their assigned responsibilities and the company's core values.

Good leaders possess great communication skills which enable them to communicate business targets while also actively listening to the challenges the workforce face. 
Effective communication can benefit a company in a number of ways. These include:

	•	strengthening the relationship of employers and employees alike
  
	•	increasing employee productivity
  
	•	better financial results
  
	•	improved employee satisfaction

### It promotes a common vision:

An organisation's vision often determines the company's future. Leaders create this vision and come up with strategies and methods to fulfil it. One approach is to teach employees about the company's goals and objectives and communicate ways to reach those targets. This information lets the team members know the company's current and future targets, how it intends to achieve them and the roles they can play to help accomplish these goals. This knowledge encourages employees to be more productive, as they can see first-hand how their efforts influence the success of the business.

### It promotes a learning culture:

Good leaders are always in the habit of sharing any information and knowledge that can promote the growth of their team members. They understand that employees need the necessary tools to work effectively. For employees to benefit the company, leadership needs to communicate and provide these tools effectively.

For example, you can organise monthly or yearly skill enhancement programmes for your team members aimed at enhancing their knowledge and increasing their technical capabilities. eg -Engineering Council forums, attending meet ups , conferences and networking.

### It fosters a culture of recognition and appreciation:

As a leader, you can promote a culture of recognition by encouraging and rewarding employees who work effectively and efficiently.
You can also recognise and appreciate an employee for their unique contributions towards a project and encourage other team members to do likewise. Employers who work in this kind of environment feel more fulfilled and motivated to carry out their tasks.

### It defines and reveals the company's core values:

Effective leadership often involves working hard to share and teach team members about the company's values and principles.


### It promotes job satisfaction:

When employees feel satisfied with their work, they become inspired to devote their time and skills towards the success of the business. Employees feel satisfied in jobs where they feel comfortable and their employers appreciate them. Different factors may influence an employee's job satisfaction, such as compensation, company's core values, promotion, quality of leadership, work environment and motivation. Effective leadership evaluates these factors to determine how they're able to satisfy the needs of their team members. 

### It defines the behaviour of employees:

Quality leaders lead by example. They understand that employees are looking up to them to know the acceptable ways of doing things in the organisation such as fulfilling their responsibilities, reacting to situations and handling projects. Therefore, effective leaders not only create company policies and rules but also live by them.
A good leader does not overlook mistakes but acknowledges them while offering directions and ways to improve. By working to embody the company's values, a good leader's behaviour and work ethic stand as models of what the company represents and stands for. With time, this begins to influence and define the behaviour of the workforce as they realise the correlation between the success of the business and their attitude.

### It boosts employee morale:

The best leaders find ways to motivate their team members and make their contributions feel valued. This includes praising and complimenting them, trusting in them and actively involving them in company decisions. Employees who work in this kind of atmosphere often feel more motivated to put in their best towards the company's growth and success.
