Unit Test

TeamCity is great for running unit test, which can nicely show the test result report and code coverage report. TeamCity supports different test frameworks. We pick {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/intro/installation.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Karma }}as our test framework, which can be used for backend apps (Node.js) as well as front-end (Angular) apps. Also, Karma is TeamCity friendly by using its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/plus/teamcity.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 TeamCity plugin }}.\
Karma has a plugin  "https://github.com/mattlewis92/karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter"

In an Angular project, Start a test by command: **ng test -code-coverage

TeamCity could generate a nice statistic report for you based on historical unit test results.
