# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a clustering architecture and provides all the orchestration and plumbering of nodes together. A typical configuration for a production environment could possibly have up to five machines. Normal recommendation is to have 3 (odd number to avert contention for resources if 1 fails) masters and 2 nodes for redundancy, resiliency and availability .

## Components

1. Pod 

Pods are wrappers, and provides abstraction for Kuubernetes on how to run  multiple containers to access CPU, Network resources to enable scaling. They are labelled to give  taxonomy to the pods. For referencing and managing. Pods interract with containers during run time.

Kubernetes uses Docker containers to deploy apps.

2. Controllers

Controllers manage Pods, and are packaged as replica sets to scale. They work on a set of rules

3. Jobs

Another use case of running pods is jobs. They can run as cron jobs (start, run and terminate). They can be invoked on triggers (as Cron jobs) or manually.

4. Services

This is a exposure of pods, replicca sets and controllers on a port through the Kube proxy.


## Tools 

1. Kubeadm  - This is an administration tool for setting up and managing Kubernetes clusters. This runs on the Kubernetes host

2. Kubectl - This is the command line interface for interracting with Kubernetes clusters

3. Minikube - A utility for setting up single node instances of Kubernetes for testing and development.


Kubectl and Minikube are easily installed with popular packge managers like apt-get (Lynx), Chokolatey (Windows) and Homebrew (mac). 


## Kubernetes in Production 

There are several ways to run Kubernetes in production environment.

1. Docker EE now has native support for Kubernetes for on premise and cloud deployments.

2. Azure Container Service (AKS) now has a managed Kubernetes platform.

3. You can also build put Kubernetes clusters on PaaS with kubeadm.
