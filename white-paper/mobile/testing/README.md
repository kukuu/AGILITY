# Useful Tools for Testing Websites on Mobile Devices


As there are more and more people using their mobile devices to browse the web, it is important to make sure that your website is compatible with the different devices with different screen sizes and operating systems.

Testing websites on mobile devices can be very time consuming and expensive due to the vast number of different mobile devices.

Luckily, there are useful tools that we can use for testing websites on mobile devices. These tools simulate a real device and will display how a website renders on a particular device with different screen resolutions.

## iPhony

Looking for a way to see how your web creations will look on iPhone? Look no further. iPhoney gives you a pixel-accurate web browsing environment—powered by Safari—that you can use when developing web sites for iPhone. It’s the perfect 320 by 480-pixel canvas for your iPhone development. And it’s free.

iPhoney is not an iPhone simulator but instead is designed for web developers who want to create 320 by 480 (or 480 by 320) websites for use with iPhone. It gives you a canvas on which to test the visual quality of your designs.

### Responsive Design Checker

This is a very easy to use tool that only checks for the responsive design. It has an intuitive interface with a range of view port sizes and popular devices to choose from.

This tool isn’t intended to test mobile site versions, so it won’t show you if your site redirects to a mobile version. Some devices, including the iPhone, automatically resize websites to fit the screen, but that’s not responsive design, so you won’t see that here, either.

### BrowserSynch

BrowserSync starts a small web server. If you’re already using a local web server or need to connect to a live website, you can start BrowserSync as a proxy server. It injects small script into every page which communicates with the server via WebSockets. When an event occurs, such as a clicking a link or scroll action, the server sends an update notification to all connected devices.
