# Useful Tools for Testing Websites on Mobile Devices


As there are more and more people using their mobile devices to browse the web, it is important to make sure that your website is compatible with the different devices with different screen sizes and operating systems.

Testing websites on mobile devices can be very time consuming and expensive due to the vast number of different mobile devices.

Luckily, there are useful tools that we can use for testing websites on mobile devices. These tools simulate a real device and will display how a website renders on a particular device with different screen resolutions.

## iPhony

Looking for a way to see how your web creations will look on iPhone? Look no further. iPhoney gives you a pixel-accurate web browsing environment—powered by Safari—that you can use when developing web sites for iPhone. It’s the perfect 320 by 480-pixel canvas for your iPhone development. And it’s free.

iPhoney is not an iPhone simulator but instead is designed for web developers who want to create 320 by 480 (or 480 by 320) websites for use with iPhone. It gives you a canvas on which to test the visual quality of your designs.
