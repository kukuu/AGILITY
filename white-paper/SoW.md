# Statement of Work (SoW)


As noted, the statement of work is a detailed overview of the project in all its dimensions. It’s also a way to share what the project entails with those who are working on the project, whether they are collaborating or are contracted to work on the project. This includes vendors and contractors who are bidding to work on the project.

It’s also helpful to the project leader, as it provides a structure on which the project plan can be built on. The statement of work will also help to avoid conflicts in the project. With detail and clarity, the SoW helps keep everyone that’s involved in the project on the same page and works to leave confusion to a minimum.

The SoW is the document that captures and defines all aspects of your project. You’ll note the activities, deliverables and the timetable for the project. It’s an extremely detailed document as it will lay the groundwork for the project plan.

It’s one of the first documents you’ll create to lay out the entire landscape of the project before you plan and execute. Because of the great amount of detail required, the prospect of writing one can be daunting. Therefore, let’s break it down into more digestible parts.


## How to Write a Statement of Work

When you’re writing a statement of work, it can help to use a template because of all the various aspects of the project that it must capture. Most templates will include things such as a glossary of terms defining what you’re referencing in the SoW. There will be a place for you to write the statement of purpose, as well as administration information.

There’s a lot of information to describe in the SoW. You can create this on your own if you want, but any measure to make sure nothing is left out will prove helpful. You only have one chance to create this document, and you want it done right.

In terms of writing the proposal, you’ll want to be specific. You want to clarify the terms used to make them universally understood. Also, clearly define who is going to do what and by what time those tasks must be completed. Doing this avoids confusion later in the project when you can’t afford any miscommunications or disputes.

Besides writing clearly, you should include visuals in the SoW. This will help focus the lens on the various aspects of the project. Including visuals, be they charts, graphs or other illustrations to help you clarify the project, will make the SoW more digestible. Remember, some people are more literate and others more visual, while most are some combination of the two. You want to speak to all types with this document.

After all the work you’ve done in detailing the specifics of the project, you don’t want to neglect the final, crucial step — getting the work signed off. You can’t proceed if you don’t have the authority to do so. Or, more accurately, you can, but it might cost you the success of the project. Therefore, make sure that those in authority have signed off on the statement of work. That includes the schedule, milestones and deliverables (SMD). By having the SoW signed, then you can deliver on it. You have the boundaries in which the work can be done, how it will be done, the duration of that work, etc. If there’s a dispute, you can show the signed document to support your actions.

The statement of work is a foundational document of any project. Once created and approved, you’ll have to create a plan and implement it. That’s where ProjectManager.com comes in.
