# Life Cycle Architecture (LCA)


## Complete Life Cycle Architectural solution focuses in the following areas:

● Architecturally Significant Requirements

● Systems Architecture (Data and Application)

● Infrastructure Architecture

● Scalability and Availability


Other architectural areas to consider to support development are: 
 

## Development

● Code Management (Graceful Degradation & Progressive Enhancement)

● Code Framework

● Code Repository (Structure and Development guidelines) and Source Control

● Components overview

● Coding Standards & Best Practices

● Error Handling & Digital Security

● Adding search functionality (Including Tokenization, Steming and Stop Words)

● Quality Control

● Client and Server side component rendering

● Cloud Computing (Services, Platforms & Infrastructure) 


## UX Patterns

● UX Best Practices - Keep It Simple (KISS)

● Responsive Web Design, Adaptive Designs & Mobile First

● Flexible Grid Systems

● Font icons


## Quality Assurance Approach

● Testing Environment & Test Coverage, The testing Pyramid Matrix

● Functionality testing through BDD test Automation

● Browser Support

● Browser testing

● Operating Systems

● Mobile Devices


## Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment

● CI Server

● Containerization

●  Cloud Computing Platforms & Service Models

●  Software as a Service (SaaS)

●  Platform as a Service (PaaS) 

●  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

●  Scalability and Availability Strategies


##  Integrating Social Media, Email & Campaign Strategies

●  Twitter
●  LinkedIn
