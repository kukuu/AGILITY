# Build Real Web App with React 

Managing the state  of the application should be fundamental for scaling your applications. REDUX is a perfect choice here as it allows you to globally manage state and perfect for scaling.

It is also visionary to make the app PWA compatible for improved user experience and adding more commercial value. Amongst the advantages of using REACT via  create-react-app (if you decide to go that route is) provides a prebuilt service worker implementation, which auto-updates when anything is changed, allowing us to create PWAs a lot faster and easier.


## Architectural Design Steps

### Scaffolding

● Defining a data structure. For example a blog post data structure could possibly have the following:

``` 

ID: a value that can uniquely identify a post

Title: a string representation of the post’s title

Image: a link to the featured image for the post

Author: a string with the post author’s name

Tags: a list of strings containing keywords about the post

Content: the string representation of the actual contents of the post

Date added: a representation of the date when the post was added


```


#### Setting up environment

``` 

create-react-app autumn-pwa

cd autumn-pwa

npm install --save redux react-redux

npm start

```

### Developmnet

● Create Application shell

● eslint setup (Initial commit and)

●  React router setup with couple of pages

●  Semantic ui setup (CSS)

●  Login (form with client-side validation)

●  Redux setup (state management)

●  Async request to server and render server validation errors

●  Login/Logout (Switch management - JWT and other middlewares)

●  Authorised routes

●  User signs up

●  User email confirmation

●  Reset password

●  Search

●  Components inclusion (Add new component)
