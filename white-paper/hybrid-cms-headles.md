# Hybrid CMS aka Headless CMS

A hybrid CMS is a content management system that supports more than one type of content delivery model. It provides full back-end content management capabilities and both a decoupled and a headless content delivery tier.

The best hybrid CMS solutions provide full content management capabilities, a structured content model and the ability to deliver content to multiple delivery tiers via decoupled delivery or headless (API). But there’s one more thing a good hybrid CMS can do.

A good hybrid CMS understands that not only should it help you manage content, but it should provide a mechanism to import or aggregate content from other repositories and apply some structure to it, so you can then make it available to your customer channels.  This is where big Data comes in. MongoDB supports big data. It is AGILE and supports dymanic schema on the fly, and also distributed processing.

Even if most organizations will have more than one content management system or content repository, a hybrid CMS is a good core foundation to start building that consistent, seamless customer experience.

With a hybrid CMS, your organization can create and manage all your content in one place and deliver it to different channels - the website, a native mobile application, a business application, or somewhere else. It gives you flexibility in how you deliver content while keeping the management of that content under one roof.

Why is this a good thing? It's good because customers want a seamless, frictionless experience. Regardless of where they engage with you on your digital properties, they want the same experience. And your content is a huge part of that experience.


## Traditional, Decouple, and Headless CMSs


Before we dive into what a hybrid CMS is, let’s look at the other three main types of web content management systems available today:

### Traditional: 

Tightly coupled front-end content delivery and back-end content management are how most define the traditional CMS. With everything tied into one platform, a traditional CMS supports your websites but not much else.


### Decoupled: 

A decoupled CMS provides both front-end and back-end capabilities, but they aren’t tightly integrated so that you can create different types of front-ends supported by one backend. With decoupled, content is pushed to the delivery tier when it is published or updated.


### Headless: 

Headless is purely a content management backend with an API that you use to pull content from the content management system to display in whatever front-end you create. A pure headless CMS offers no front-end capabilities at all, giving you full control of your customer experience. However, it also doesn’t provide things such as personalization, content targeting, analytics and other capabilities critical to delivering good customer experiences.
