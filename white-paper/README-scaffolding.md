#  Platform Blue Print - Scaffolding / Discovery 

The patterns and best practices mentioned here should be discussed, mitigated and covered (be in place) in any software development cycle before coding begins. This is normally an agenda for SPRINT 0, and during the period of writing up the SDD (Software Design Document).


## AGILITY 

Agile management involves the division of a company into small teams of employees, each one acting like a start-up in its own right. The aim is to change the way in which your company runs to meet the ever-changing demands of the global market. The ‘Agile Manifesto,’ highlights key messages behind the system – including self-organisation, collaboration and cross-functionality of teams.

Lean Agile Leadership is established through empowerment: Building, autonomous, self-organising, cross functional and collaboration.

## Digital Transformation 

Digital transformation is more than technology. It is a mindset shift. It is the adoption of new ways of working and ultimately it is the marrying of people and process to gain a competitive advantage.

### The CADMA Strategy

1. Create a vision.

2. Analyze market.

3. Design the experience.

4. Measure impact 

5. Adjust infrastructure.

### The Framework

DSF can be built around the following. The exact structure will vary depending on the specific needs of the business:

	1. Understand the Corporate Strategy and business domain

	2. Assess current state of IT Strategy and understanding  existing systems and processes

	3. Define Initiatives 

	4. Develop a Strategy Roadmap

		i. Objective setting and measures of success (What you want to achieve - 
			digitally and as a wider business)

		ii. Opportunity Analysis - What you could be doing and potential rewards

		iii. Barrier analysis - What’s stopping you doing this? How we can get around this

		iv. Customer profiling and needs analysis - How you could serve your audiences better

	     v. Stakeholder engagement and Market Analysis.

	5. Communicate  strategy



## SPRINT 0

The main goal of a Sprint Zero is to deliver some usable value that can be built upon by the next team. Sprint Zeros are required to: 

1. Security and Encryption -  https://github.com/kukuu/AGILITY/blob/master/white-paper/security-encryption.md 

2. Create the project's skeleton, including research spikes.

3. Get some quality items on the Product Backlog

4. A list of all prioritized features/stories with estimates

5. A release plan that assigns each feature/story to an iteration/sprint

6. A high-level application architecture, i.e. how the features will likely be implemented

6. Provide a minimal environment that enables the writing of quality code

7. Write a piece of real code, no matter how small.

8. Agree on a definition of done and rebuild confidence with the customer.

 ## Softwared Architecture & Standards
 
 Software architecture refers to the high level structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations.

The architecture  is a blend of technical decisions and architectural patterns, and considered the root of a software project, to ensure its scalability, security, quality, cost effectiveness and longevity.

The architecture is made so the code structure can satisfy every software prerequisite that is being developed while exemplifying transversal attributes such as performance, quality, scalability, maintainability, manageability, and usability.

Failure of attributes may result in productivity loss for users, damaged customer relations, revenue loss, cost overruns due to redesign, and missed market windows. Therefore, a software architect must focus on the initial issues in the development process during the architectural design phase, to avoid poor performance.

In order to start testing the design against requirements and assumptions, don't try to get it all right in the first attempt. Iteratively add details to the design over different tries, to ensure that you get the big decision right first, and then focus on the details later. A common setback is to dive into the details too quickly to evaluate your architecture effectively.
 
You can use multiple patterns in a single system to optimize each section of code with the best architecture.

 ### Adaptable Design
 
Adaptable designs are on trend to enhance viability. Developers prefer using flexible designs because they make use of free linking, whose impact on viability is imperative. By using pluggable designs, developers are able to offer extensibility even in the post-deployment period. You can use service-oriented architecture (SOA) and different strategies in service orientation to provide interoperability with other programming frameworks.


 ### Points to consider during Software Architecture Development
 
A software architect must:

1. Define the solution clearly.

2. Manage internal and external stakeholders who will interface with the software. Consider the following: 

```

i.  The concerns of the end users, including right and instinctive behavior, reliability,
performance, security, availability, and usability.

ii.  The concerns of the system administrator, including intuitive behavior, observing, 
and administrative tools.

iii. The concerns of the marketer, including cost, positioning relative to other software, 
time for marketing and competitive features.

iv.  The concerns of the customer, which incorporate: cost, schedule, and stability.

v.   The concerns of the developer, including project requirements and a steady yet basic
design approach.

vi. The concerns of the project manager include budget, schedule, and consistency, as it 
identifies with following the task, and the most effective use of the available resources.

vii. The concerns of the maintainer, which include the simplicity of making modifications,
and a consistent and complete design approach that is well documented.

```


### TOGAF

The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) is a framework for enterprise architecture that provides an approach for planning, design, implementing, and governing an enterprise information technology architecture.

TOGAF is a high level approach to design, and relies heavily on modularization, standardization, and already existing, proven technologies and products.It is typically modeled at four levels (Domain): 

```
Business 

Application 

Data 

Technology

```

https://github.com/kukuu/AGILITY/blob/master/white-paper/togaf.jpg


### The Discovery phase


The primary focus should be on user research, not technical design, but that you should be gathering all the information you need to make sure you know what you need to learn and test in an alpha, and can make sure that any proposals resulting from the discovery are informed by a solid understanding of the surrounding technology landscape and how it’s changing.  That means knowing what data held elsewhere you’re likely to depend on, which systems will be expecting data from you, what interfaces with other systems you’ll need to test, and so on.

#### Skillset

Discovery should also be telling you about other capabilities that are likely to be needed, including the delivery team who will work on the alpha.

When working on discovery for another organisation it will often be necessary for the architect to gauge the skills of the team currently available. As you understand the technology context you will need to get a sense of whether the skills that exist in the organisation are the ones needed for alpha (and to an extent beyond) in order to advise on training and recruitment that might be needed.

Most of the exploration of particular solutions should be left for the alpha phase, but early prototyping is a very good thing and it’s often a good idea to begin exploring what you’re learning during discovery with throwaway code and experimentation with new tools.


#### The organisational structure

An architect in discovery should try to make sure that everything is easier to understand for future teams, whether a team doing something based on that discovery or anyone else revisiting the same organisation, systems or services.

Any previous common technology decisions the organisation has already made (e.g. preferred databases or programming languages) has to be understood, so you can take an informed position on how that will work for your service, can push back if there are significant advantages to taking a different approach, and know who to talk to in order to make sure you can take advantage of common platforms as you get a better understanding of what your service needs to do.


#### Understanding Legacy Systems

It’s important to understand legacy systems that other services  relate to in order to determine what your options are.


Could you replace those other systems cleanly? Would a one-off copy of the data from the old system to a new one do the job? Will you need to maintain data in the old system, and if so are there real-time APIs that will let you do that, or will there need to be batch (or manual) reconciliation?

It’s also important to remember that often the challenge with accessing and understanding those systems isn’t technical, but contractual and that your team will need access to the right commercial and legal expertise to handle that.
