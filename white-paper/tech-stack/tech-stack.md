# The Technology Stack

The technology stack is a kit of tools and frameworks that are used in the development of a software product. In other words, it is the combination of programming languages, frameworks and tools that are used by the developers for the development of web and mobile applications.

```

Client-side (Front-end)

Server-side (Back-end)


```

### Client-side Programming

From client-side(Front-end) web application development involves everything users see on their screens. Here are the major frontend technology stack components:

#### HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) 

This defines the structure of the information presented in the browser.


#### Cascading Style Sheets

CSS determines the style of the application content such as colour, fonts, and layouts.


#### JavaScript 

JS enables the interactivity of the web page in which the app is running.

Most of the web applications are built with Bootstrap as the framework for HTML and CSS. It is considered the most expansive library with a great user base and thousands of stars on GitHub. While Bootstrap is the most popular framework it is not the only on the market. The second most used after Bootstrap is Foundation which shows good performance. Others also include Material UI, GRIDS etc.

When it comes to JavaScript, components are a field of fierce competition of front-end frameworks, the most used are Angular and React. Both are well-known for their high performance and flexibility, and both have huge armies of supporters and contributors. Moreover, both of them work equally well regardless of the tools used on the back end.


## Server-side or Back-end?

The server-side components aren’t visible to the users, but it powers the client-side, just as a power station generates electricity for your home. The most challenges lie majorly in the choice of the server-side technology for developing your web application. As server-side programming languages, they are used to create the logic of websites and applications. Frameworks for programming languages offer lots of tools for milder and faster coding. All back-end tech stacks hold the following main parts:


### The Operating System (OS)

An operating system where the development part takes place
Web server request processing from the browser and returning the corresponding content.
A database that stores the app data
A programming language which utilizes to create the app code
Web development framework used for faster and easier development. The web framework directly depends on the selection of the programming language.
As you all know the web application requires a place to store the data and that’s what is known as a database. 

### Databases

In general, there are two types of databases:

Relational
Non-relational

Here are the most typical databases for web development:

```
MySQL (relational)

PostgreSQL (relational)

MongoDB (non-relational, document)

```

### Caching

A web application requires a caching system to reduce the load on the database and to handle large amounts of traffic. Memcached and Redis are the most popular caching systems. Finally, a web application requires a server to handle requests from the client’s computers. There are two major players in this domain:

```
Apache 

Nginx

```

## Picking the right Client and Server stacks for development


With this wide variety of web development tools, platforms and stacks, choosing the one that will work best for your project development may seem like a difficult task. That’s absolutely the true fact, choosing the technology is a project within a project and needs certain effort, but this choice determines how your application is going to create a run and maintained.

### Project Size and Type

The first and foremost thing to decide upon is the type of web application you’re developing. A tech stack is a toolset for developing a web application, so you need to fully realize what you’re planning to build in order to pick the appropriate tools. You should determine a toolset that provides unique advantages for your web application. The volume and complexity of your project may be a factor determining the stack that you choose to develop it.


#### Complexity 

Software projects can be classified into 3 types based on the complexity:


##### Low complexity
Low Complexity projects involve out-of-the-box-solutions, CMS, web templates appliance to build landing pages, plain e-shops, and applications; minimum staffing is involved when developing.


##### Medium complexity

Medium complexity projects such as online stores, marketplaces, enterprise solutions are usually created based on frameworks; involve staff from more than one department.
High complexity projects imply eCommerce solutions, large portals, data-based applications development with a combination of frameworks, software languages, tools, accelerators; extensive cross-departmental interaction.
Once you are done with the type of web application to develop that is not just enough; you should take its business goals into account as well. This is a very primary thing to do because your goals impact the choice of technologies for development. Your web app can be tailored for:

##### Heavy Load Processing

If your web project relies on load processing, you should opt for programming languages and frameworks that can provide this. Examples of such outlines are video/audio streaming apps and file sharing services.
Low Latency – A different tech stack is required to make your web application highly responsible and to reduce latency. Social networks are apparently the best example of websites that require low latency.


##### Time to market:

Time to market is extremely important when choosing a tech stack for small businesses. The faster you develop and release your application, the more ahead of opponents you’ll be. Moreover, the less time development needs the cheaper the development cost.

Time to Market depends on the technology stack you select for your web application and here’s a list of the issue you consider when choosing a proper stack:

## Issues to consider choosing Technlogy Stack

### Out of the box solutions

It is also known as Off-the-Shelfreferser to software that can be installed ready-made for the general public. One of the positives of the mentioned software is ready to be installed.
Third Party Integration –  Ensure the tech stack you selected enables a great number of third-party integration as it helps you to add the functions that you need in your web application without reinventing the wheel.

### Availability of developers 

In order to turn your idea into a great and outstanding web application solution then you need to find a skilful and experienced team who can apply the chosen tools. But it just not ended here at all the support should be proceeded even after the web application launched.


### Documentation and developer community 

While coding any developers team will encounter the tricky issues and solving the problem can be time-consuming. Big developer communities rich documents and specifications can help to handle issues in order not to miss the web application project deadlines.


### Easy testing

Every digital product contains coding lines that will certainly have bugs to be fixed. It is a must thing to remove all the failures that bottleneck the development process. Testing solutions that help to avoid this problem as some of them include test-driven approach by default to warrant the quality.


### Development Cost:

It’s not that much necessary to say turning your idea into a real-life web application is not for free of charge and requires investment. The charges will depend on applying software tools when developing a web product. Consider the positive correlation between selected software stack and cost when the tech stack is more advanced the that imply the high development cost. There are two main problems you need to consider:


#### Developer Salaries

Web developers are highly professionals who are rather well-paid. However, their salaries depend on the technologies they work with. Simultaneously, your expenses will be different depending on the tech stack. You should remember that more advanced the technology is the higher the developer salary will be.


####App Maintenance cost

Developing the web application is just like one side of the coin; maintaining it is the other. To diminish maintenance costs, you should opt for free open-source technologies.


### Scalability:

Growing products require a well-defined scalability matrix that should have scenarios for both scale up(Vertical) and scale out(Horizontal).


###### Scale up or vertically

Enabling you to add other software for new tasks

Scale out or horizontally – allowing it to handle increased volumes of a request


### Security:

Always ensure the web application is developed on the safety principles in order to avoid threats, minimize critical areas. It is needed to select software technologies that have safety and security instructions in order to create a  highly secure, protected web product.

## Critical Advice

Pick a Technology Stack According to Your Project

As you can see, selecting the proper tech stack is a real challenge, but the core idea that should guide you is as follows: Choose the technologies according to your project. Never rely on time-proven technologies only, even if they have been used by some large and successful companies or prominent projects have been accomplished with their help.

Always be genuine and take all the pros and cons into account. The wrong selection of a technology stack may end in financial losses, so if you aren’t experienced in web development, leave the choice to professionals. A team of professional web developers will be able to choose the right tools for delivering a top-notch web application with all the functionality you require.


### Bottom Line

Determining the software technologies based on the requirements of the future products is the underlying concept. It is not a good idea to defer to time-tested tools, even if powerful successful organizations have applied them. You want to find the right tech partner or company for great product delivery in order not to break down the budget with the false choice.
