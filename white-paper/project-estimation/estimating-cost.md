# Agile project estimation and software development costs


```

To take a basic scenario, we take the total number of story points we got from sizing our backlog 
and divide that by our teams anticipated velocity. (NB velocity is normally expressed as a range,
but for simplicity, we’ll use a single number here.) We work in two week iterations so our 
velocity will be reflected by how much we can complete in a two week cycle with the available
capacity of the team. If our story points totaled 120 and we anticipate completing 20 points per
iteration, the total development duration would be 12 weeks or 6 iterations. We add to that a
sprint 0 of 2 weeks and a release preparation sprint of two weeks. In total, our project length
is 16 weeks. There are techniques we can use that would help build an appropriate risk buffer 
into our planning, which we’ll discuss later. But in short, we use the buffer to manage the
risk of uncertainty and to come to a minimum agreement of expected story points to be delivered.
The outcome might be a range of 90 to 150 story points delivered, 90 being the minimum that
would be acceptable to create a viable product.

When it comes to software, understanding duration and cost are key in making strategic business decisions and this is true whether you’re creating a startup, realizing a new business opportunity, or enabling your business to perform better. The timing, return on investment and benefit delivered can make, shake or break your business. You’ll be asking yourself: What do we get for our money? Can we predict our costs? What will it cost to create the product we want? When can we launch? Will we get a quality product for our investment? Will it grow with our business? Will it deliver business value?

So, how do you go about estimating the size, duration, and cost of a project? Let’s explore Agile project estimation and software development costs, and how we do it at Toptal.

``` 

i. How do you know that the functionality you fix at the outset of a project really is the functionality that serves your business or customers best? More often than not, functionality or scope will change, which is why we hear about ‘scope creep,’ the outcome of desired needs being identified through the lifecycle of a project and being determined as necessary or compulsory

ii. When cost becomes a variable we lose control over the return on investment (ROI) that we’re seeking to achieve. Increased cost is often a product of unidentified risks or changing requirements, which means we have to add team members to do more work in the same time frame or keep team members longer. Neither is desirable.


iii. When time is a variable, we lose control over the position in our market. Perhaps we miss an important industry date or our competitors get their product out before us, thus losing any competitive advantage our project may have had.


iv. Of course, many customers and organizations seek to fix all three components of this ‘magic triangle’. Unfortunately, it’s nigh on impossible to realistically achieve. There are too many elements that conspire to unsettle this ideal, which ultimately end in products that don’t meet a need, take too long to benefit its customers or cost too much to realize business value.


```

## Agile Contracts for Software Projects

```

i. Cost is a product of time and people (team members). Add more time, and you add cost for employing people for longer. 

ii. Add more team members, and you increase the cost to deliver the same business value. The things we really want to avoid. This is why Agile principles believe in fixing time and team members and allowing the scope to be the variable component.


```

Which sounds better and increases stakeholder confidence, fixed cost or variable cost?

Of course, it’s important that a product delivers on its promises and the needs of its customers. It’s no good spending an exact amount of time and an exact amount of money if, in the end, you have a product that nobody wants or can use effectively.



## So Agile contracts focus on the following costing mechanisms

```

i. Fixed price work packages 

The whole project is broken down into logical ‘mini’ releases which contribute to the full product outcome. Each release is a work package that is priced accordingly. As a work package is completed, future work packages are re-estimated based on what we have learned from the previous one. This avoids unnecessary contingency and allows for a level of re-prioritization and new/revised features to be defined by the customer.


ii. Early termination

 This allows the customer to seek to terminate the project early if enough of the product has been delivered and there is no further ROI to be achieved by retaining a project team that will only continue to deliver marginal gains. This clause is typically allowed at any time and is valid as long as the project team and customer have maintained a strong, trusting and close working collaborative relationship. The benefit for the customer is that the project will finish early, having delivered all the valuable features necessary to make the product viable. In return, the supplier is paid 20 percent of the remaining contract value and offsets the risk of retaining staff.

 iii. Additional work 

 Through the life of a project, more features may be identified that would not be achievable under the existing fixed price contract. For this scenario, either additional newly priced work packages can be added to the end of the project or revert to time and materials.

 iv. Ranged estimates

 There are two ways that estimates can be ranged in an Agile project contract: a range of duration or a range of features. 

 a. A range of duration allows for an estimate to say that the project or work package will take 12 to 16 weeks for a given set of scope. However, adding duration adds cost as you keep project team members for longer, or it means they can’t be released to work on other development projects. 

 Agilie practice prefers to range features across a range of story points (matching features across storypoints), keeping the scope as the variable but promising to deliver a minimum level of value to the customer within the fixed time frame of the work package or overall project.

``` 

It’s worth remembering that you can always add more scope later. Perhaps you’ve started to earn revenue, you’ve increased users or reduced costs. Either way, it’s much easier to ask for more money and time if you’ve already demonstrated a return or improvement and are delivering business value.
