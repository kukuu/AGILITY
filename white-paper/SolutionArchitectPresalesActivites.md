# Solution Architect - Pre sales activites

Most but not all case studies are looking for you to demonstrate your business acumen more than your technical one. For example will the CFO really care that you have recommended Sun E10k instead of the HP equivalent. What they are much more interested in is how that benefits the business and never forget this, them personally.



## Foundation

The  foundation for a successful case is set at the beginning, so follow these steps religiously during your interview practice:

1. Restate the question and make sure you understand the problem statement by confirming with the interviewer. ...

2. Clarify the goals. ...

3. Write out your structure.

```

i. Before you begin writing, follow these guidelines to help you prepare and understand the case study:


ii. Read and Examine the Case Thoroughly. Take notes, highlight relevant facts, underline key problems.


iii. Focus Your Analysis. Identify two to five key problems. ...


iv. Uncover Possible Solutions/Changes Needed. ...


v. Select the Best Solution.

Be prepared to make a decision on one of your options. You cannot be right or wrong as there is too little information but do not be afraid to make a choice. It will count against you if you don't.

## Program Overview - Summarising


(Goal)
The overall goal of the project was to seek to standardize across the organization and all of the 20+ business units. The business units are primarily autonomous with different types of technology and infrastructure and at varying degrees of maturity and security. The status quo presented a series of risks to both the organization as well as each of the business units.

(Touching on ROI)
The cost/benefits were multiple not just in terms of standardization but also the total cost of ownership (TCO) and Return on Security Investment (ROSI) to purchase technology at volume discount while gaining increased visibility and support from the vendor(s).

(Benefit - Long term)
 However, the primary goal and benefit was to establish and foster a spirit of collaboration, sharing and, cross-pollination to work together towards a common vision.
