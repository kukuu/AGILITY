# Big Data



The biggest challenge to big data is storing and processing the data at a specified time span. By 2020 it is predicted that each human being will be producing 1.7 megabytes of data every second. These cannot be thrown away or ignored.


## Validation & Analysis

1. Capture data

2. Conduct analysis for efficiency

3. Leverage benefits of Big Data by analysing patterns, trends and predicting something 
useful out of it

4. Use the results to improve customer experience and bring profit to business



## Challenges

The challenges for Big Data is enshrined in it's 3V model: VOLUME, VELOCITY and VARIETY.


1. Volume 

Data storage volumes are normally very high. Running into terrabytes. 

i. Social Media:  Youtube, Chatbot etc

ii. Machine sensors

iii. Personal Health Checkers

iv. Organisations: Credit Card details, Merchant transactions, Medical records.



2. Velocity

Data has to be processed at faster speeds.

i. Batch processing

ii. Real time execution

iii. Streaming



3. Variety

Examples: Videos, images, Tweets

i. Structured

ii. non- structured

iii. Semi-structured



Hadoop tecnologies is used to solve  this problem within big data environment. Most of the tools save time and money in covering business insight. The tools can be divided into the following categories:


## Tools

The advantages of Big Data Tools include:


1. Provides the Analyst with advanced analysis algorithms and models.

2. Can run on Big Data platforms such as Hadoop, or any high performance analysis system.

3. Can work with structured, unstructured and semi-structured data from multiple sources.

4. Easy to visualise the analysed data.

5. Easy to integrate with other technologies.

## Big Data Popular use cases


1. IoT

i. Sensors are used to collect data. They can be analysed to achieve actionable insight, tracking customers or product movement.

ii. Enterprises are creating dashboard applications which provide 360 degrees views and tracking customers data from a variety of sources.

iii. The data is analysed and presented to customer services. Allowing customer services to gather rich insights about business.



2.  Data Warehouse Optimisation

Big Data tools are used to remove some burden from the warehouses


3. Information Security.

Information gathered from sensors and through data exchange is used in Cyber Security, manage Cyber Security incidences and threats against humans and public and private properties.

4. Health Care & Public Health

Here trends and patterns are used for treating patients from Big Data
