# What Is Your Greatest Weakness?

Even though the question is about weaknesses, your answer should always be framed around positive aspects of your skills and abilities as an employee.

You can mention skills that aren't critical for the job, discuss skills you have improved on, or turn a negative into a positive.

Turn a Negative Into a Positive

Examples:

1. When I'm working on a project, I don't want just to meet deadlines. Rather, I prefer to complete the project well ahead of when it is due. While this means I never miss a deadline, it also means that sometimes I can find myself rushed when I’m working. I’ve since learned to slow down, be more patient and give each project the careful attention it deserved.

2. One skill I improved in the past was my salesmanship skills. As a product manager who works with internal teams and does not interface with clients or sales prospects, I don’t do much, if any, ‘selling’ in my role. However, since I do communicate quite frequently with the sales team, I felt it might benefit me to have a greater understanding of their sales strategies and tactics. I took a sales skills course online and not only did it improve how I work with sales teams. Now, when I join sales  meetings, I have a much better idea of what’s going and feel more effective communicating with the sales team. This course also helped me build upon the skills I use to ‘sell’ my vision for the product internally.

3. I have a very strong attention to detail. Sometimes, this attention to detail can turn into perfectionist tendencies. In the past, I found this leading me to triple-check every item on a spreadsheet, or closely proofreading emails to ensure I’ve communicated what I’m trying to get across in a clear, concise way, or fiddling with the layout of a presentation to ensure that it is perfect. I’ve since learned to successfully budget my time and gauge which tasks require, and actually benefit from, this precise attention to detail.
