# HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status Code is a list of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) response status codes. Status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. 

They are response codes given by web site servers on the internet. The codes help identify the cause of the problem when a web page or other resource does not load properly.

It includes codes from IETF Request for Comments (RFCs), other specifications, and some additional codes used in some common applications of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The first digit of the status code specifies one of five standard classes of responses.
