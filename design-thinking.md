# Design thinking  

Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process which seeks to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test.

A design mindset is not problem-focused, it's solution focused and action oriented towards creating a preferred future.

DT has a human-centered core. It encourages organizations to focus on the people they're creating fo, which leads to better products, services, and internal processes. It turns creativity and data into growth.

## Process of Design Thinking

### Empathize and define

The first step of design thinking is to understand the problem you’re trying to solve through observing and actually talking to your customers. Then, in the define stage, you’ll consolidate and analyze the information you gathered to define the core problem.

You won’t be able to talk to all of your customers in person, so get familiar with video conferencing software like Join.me that will let you talk to anyone from around the world

#### Tools

i. Join.me

Join.me lets you share your screen, schedule invitations, and record calls—and you can claim your own personalized meeting URL to share with participants, allowing them to attend via desktop, VoIP, mobile, or phone.

ii. Board

As you wrap up user research and usability tests, you’ll move into the define stage, where you’ll work to analyze those findings and establish elements to help users resolve their problems. Boards can help you put everything in one place for ultra-easy sharing and collaborating with coworkers. You can drag and drop graphics, video and audio files, color swatches, font files, and more.

You can create a to-do list and share.


### Ideate

During this stage, you’re ready to start generating ideas. You understand your users and their needs. Armed with this information, you can explore creative ways to solve the problem.

#### Tools

i. Freehand

Freehand is an entirely new way to creatively collaborate in InVision. You can wireframe, plan, design presentations, and gather feedback in real time across mobile, web, and tablet. Freehand gives everyone on your team the power to share their ideas in a way that makes sense to them, whether that’s sketching, drawing, dropping in images or inspiration, or typing up their feedback in a comment box.


ii. Coggle

Visualize your ideas with Coggle, an online tool for creating and sharing mindmaps. You can take notes, brainstorm, or plan design ideas and share with as many colleagues as you like. Drag and drop images, add floating text and annotations, and create loops and branches to organize information.


iii. 5. Focus Booster


The ideation phase is a great space for all of the ideas and creativity you’ve got. To help make your brainstorming sessions long enough for ideas to flow but short enough to stay productive, use a timer like Focus Booster. 

Focus Booster works with the Pomodoro Technique, breaking up work into 25-minute blocks followed by five-minute breaks.


### Prototype

Now you’ve had some solid brainstorming time and you’re ready to meet one of your ideas IRL. In the prototyping stage, you’ll produce scaled-down versions of the product so you can see how it works in real life.


#### Tools

i. InVision 

InVision Studio lets you design, prototype, and animate—all in one place. With flexible layers and an infinite canvas, it’s easy to turn ideas into powerful designs.

Thanks to point-and-shoot prototyping, a comprehensive gesture picklist, and instant playback, you can create fluid interactions and high-fidelity prototypes faster than ever. You can then preview your work directly within Studio, quickly adjusting and scaling your vision to fit any screen or layout, automatically.

ii. Craft 

Craft is a suite of plugins to let you design with real data in mind. Want to make your prototypes more realistic? Craft lets you add real, unique content with a click. No more copying and pasting, or making up fake usernames. You can even add in content from live web pages.



### Test

In the final phase of design thinking, you’ll test the complete product to ensure it solves the problem you defined. This will involve user testing and usability studies, often leading you to redefine one or more problems based on the new insights you gather.


#### Tools 

i. Ethnio 

Ethnio lets you create elegant recruiting screeners to find the right participants for your in-person or remote testing via your website, iOS or Android app, or shared link. Then, once you’ve identified the right people, you can use Ethnio’s automated tool to customize every email your participants receive, send them automatic reminders, and more.


ii. Lookback 

Talk to your users and see how they’re using your app or website with Lookback. You can easily set up live, moderated testing with anyone in the world, recording faces, screens, and voices. If you want to scale your user research you can send a self-test, allowing them to participate on their own time.
