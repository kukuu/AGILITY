# Building Successful Supplier-Client Relationships

## Form a relationship with your client

Understand the project you are undertaking, right from the outset, and make sure that your client understands the context of your business to avoid any misconceptions.

Invite the designers to your site. This way they can begin to understand the context in which their designs are being produced and the people who create them.

Skype - This is amongst the perfect opportunity to meet and discuss with international clients should this not be possible and for continuous discussions throughout the course of the project.

Creating this open dialogue between supplier and designer from the beginning helps to create mutual confidence in being open with one another and will in turn help prevent any future mishaps.

With new designers whom may not be used to dealing with external suppliers and the technicalities that may arise, this relationship can be mutually beneficial.

You may also be dealing with individuals whom have never worked in your country before and are not yet accustomed to the cultural differences and different styles of business etiquette.

##  Be honest with your capabilities

Highlight your strengths and what makes you stand out from potential competitors, don’t take on an order unless you have the actual capacity to fulfil it to a high quality standard. It is common throughout business and social culture to sometimes say ‘yes’ to a question or request being made in an effort to avoid disappointment.

Make it clear to clients as to what it is you handle and what you do not. It is safer to be on the side of caution, than to take on orders that you may not be able or prepared to meet. 

It’s more disappointing when a promise you’ve made is not delivered or a high level of quality is not achieved.

##  Transparency throughout the manufacturing process

Be clear and honest about your situation throughout the entire production run – capacity, working time, stresses, cultural and practical contexts or limitations. This will help designers develop a product which works to both their and your best abilities and time frames; and to be flexible if lead-times shift.


## Understand your client

Different cultural business etiquette and their past sourcing experience.
Different nationalities conduct business in diverse ways and it is important to be open to working with people whose communication style is a little different to yours. A good partnership will be a mutual effort from both sides to jump this hurdle.

For instance, certain suppliers are often concerned that any news that is less than positive would be upsetting to the designer so tend not to share the honest details. When in actual fact, even bad news can be reassuring and allows for the designer to reconsider their original ideas and creatively resolve those problems.

It may be that a supplier will not want to ask the designer any questions, fearing they will appear incompetent – whereas in reality, the designer will take comfort in being asked extra questions and feel the manufacturer is being extra careful, thereby minimising potential future problems.

Clients will also come to you with varied backgrounds and different working knowledge of outsourcing suppliers. There are typically three types of different clients you might encounter:



``` 
The first type of client will generally have a good technical background and provide technical packs
in ready to go condition. 


That second type of client will often be a little more culturally in tune but say be 
surprised by the total cost of production.


And the third type of client will potentially require for the supplier to help play a bigger 
role in the design finalisation and technical pack finishing. 
```


It’s a wise idea to ask plenty of questions at the outset of working with a new client to figure
out how much or how little knowledge they have about the process and what their communication style is.


##  Provide clients with POCs/RAD templates 	where possible

It can be a very good idea to construct your own templates for production orders and technical specification 

By using your own template you will also become in charge of a formula you are familiar with and thereby identify problems and areas that may need addressing earlier and quicker.


## Communication is Key: Communicate clearly and often

At every stage of the develoment process it is important to communicate with the designer. Check over any detail, no matter how small or large.

If you are unclear, or there are changes from the pdevelopment product, make sure to communicate this with the designer. This will prevent any surprises for your client at the end.

Suppliers should ask questions for even the smallest detail if there is any doubt at all or if the type of work requested poses problems.

Here communication gaps can arise due to the simple fact that the designer mainly wants clear information and the supplier often wants to simply reassure the designer that all is being taken care of.

Honesty and attention to detail throughout the production process is best.


## Respect for the individual and importance of teamwork

How you structure and organise yourself as a supplier will have a domino effect on the relationships you build with your clients and the way in which you handle your business and projects.

It is therefore of fundamental importance to create a respectful, transparent and strong work force where individuals are given the opportunity to speak freely. A good way to do this is to create an open discussion forum that meets regularly with defined agendas and employees can update and input.
