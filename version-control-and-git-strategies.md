# Version Contron and Git Strategies

Both are effective best practices used collaboratively in Software development.

## Version Control
Version control system (VCS), also known as a source control system or revision control system, is a software tool that helps track and manage changes to files and documents over time. It provides a systematic way to manage different versions of files, enabling collaboration among multiple users, tracking changes, and facilitating the merging and branching of code or other project assets.

Using a version control system is considered a best practice in software development and other collaborative projects. It helps teams manage complexity, work efficiently, and maintain the integrity and history of their code or project assets.

Commonly used version control systems include Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial, and Perforce. These systems provide command-line interfaces, graphical user interfaces, and integrations with popular development tools and IDEs.

The primary purpose of a version control system is to maintain a historical record of changes made to a project, allowing developers to:

### Track Changes: 
VCS keeps a log of all modifications made to files, including who made the changes, when they were made, and the specific lines of code or content that were added, modified, or deleted.

### Collaborate: 
VCS enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts. It allows them to work on separate branches or copies of the code and later merge their changes together.

### Rollback and Recovery:
VCS allows developers to revert to earlier versions of files or the entire project in case of errors, bugs, or unwanted changes. This feature helps in recovering from mistakes and restoring a stable state of the project.

### Branching and Merging: 
VCS supports creating branches, which are independent lines of development. Developers can create separate branches for new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Branches can later be merged back into the main branch, incorporating the changes made.

### Traceability and Accountability: 
VCS provides a historical trail of who made each change and when, promoting accountability and transparency. This information can be useful for debugging, auditing, and understanding the evolution of the project.

## Git strategies: 
Also known as Git workflows or branching strategies, are approaches and guidelines for managing version control and collaboration in a Git repository. These strategies define how developers work with branches, handle code changes, merge code, and coordinate their efforts within a Git-based development environment. Here are some commonly used Git strategies:

### Centralized Workflow: 
This is a simple workflow where a single branch, typically called "master" or "main," represents the main codebase. Developers clone the repository, make changes locally, and push their changes to the central repository, directly updating the master branch.

### Feature Branch Workflow: 
Developers create a new branch for each feature or task they are working on. They make changes in their feature branches, test them, and then merge them back into the main branch (e.g., master or develop) once the feature is complete. This allows for independent development of features without directly affecting the main branch.

### Gitflow Workflow: 
This workflow is designed for projects with regular releases and emphasizes strict branch management. It uses two main branches: "develop" for ongoing development and "master" for stable releases. Feature branches, release branches, and hotfix branches are created and merged back into the appropriate branches following a defined process.

### Forking Workflow: 
This workflow is commonly used in open-source projects where contributors do not have direct write access to the main repository. Each contributor forks the main repository, makes changes in their forked repository, and submits pull requests to the main repository for code review and integration. The maintainers of the main repository decide whether to accept or reject the changes.

### Pull Request Workflow: 
This workflow involves creating feature branches for development, making changes in those branches, and then submitting a pull request to merge the changes into the main branch. The pull request serves as a platform for code review, discussion, and collaboration before the changes are merged.
