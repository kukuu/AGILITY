This is what John Cox, Plant Manager, Ford Motors Enfield, Middlesex London had to say whiles I worked there:
 
```

I had the pleasure of working with Alexander during his period here at Ford Motors in Enfield 
as an internship student. Alexander did an outstanding job in his assignment. He carefully planned
out his strategy, investigated problem areas and communicated his actions effectively. He quickly
became an integral part of our team very quickly and participated in other activities outside of his
area of expertise to further enhance his time here. 

The project Alexander completed has been successfully implemented. With his assistance, we 
successfully passed an external audit for ISO9000 certification and have established a new 
benchmark that other areas of our location globally  will be following - John Cox, Plant Manager
