# Web Services

A web service is a collection of open protocols and standards  used for exchanging data between applications or systems over the internet and uses a standardized XML messaging  system. XML is used to encode all communications to a web service. For  example, a client invokes a web service by sending an XML message, then  waits for a corresponding XML response.

 As all communication is in XML,  web services are not tied to any one operating system or programming  language - Java can talk with Perl; Windows applications can talk with  Unix applications.

 Web services are self-contained, modular, distributed, dynamic  applications. These  applications can be local, distributed, or web-based. Web services are  built on top of open standards such as TCP/IP, HTTP, Java, HTML, and  XML.
