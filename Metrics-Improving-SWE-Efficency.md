#  Improving Software Engineering Efficiency and Productivity

 
In today’s fast-paced technological landscape, tomorrow’s products are already at risk of being “old news.”  

Focus must be directed at building high performance engineering teams. One with a quick turn around, and also with a minimum or no down time.

Traits of high performance engineering team includes but not limited to:

```
1. Meeting deadlines, and hiting targets from planning

2. Achieving definition of done,(DoD) over SPRINT period. From requirement gathering to production.

3. Managing low fault levels. Less or minimum  return rates/complaints/bugs from users

```

To overcome lengthy production cycles, successful software developers are focusing on efficiency and productivity. Greater efficiency leads to greater productivity, accelerated product life cycles, shorter time to market and, ultimately, an increased bottom line.

 Engineering team managers can use many metrics to gauge efficiency and productivity along the way. But of course, the ultimate measure of a software application’s success is whether it meets end users’ needs and improves the organization’s business results.
 
 ## KPIs
 
 Achieving these KPIs requires the adoption of Lean Engineering Practices including, but not limited to:
 
 AREST
 
 ```
Automation - Deployment should happen automatically. Creating and publishing packages are for the dark ages!

Reproducible - Production environment should be the same as the development environment. Issues in production should be easy to reproduce in development. 

Elastic - Easy to scale up or down services based upon demand.

Smooth - Zero downtime while scaling or upgrading the service. Process of re-instating a failed build should be trivial.

Traceable - Logging & monitoring should be in place to watch for issues


## Tracking the metrics

Keeping track of certain metrics is an important step in making sure your company’s software engineering team is performing as efficiently and productively as possible. Here are some of the most essential metrics for developers to track:

### Lead time 

Lead time is a general measurement of the amount of time that passes from product concept to final delivery. It will depend on project complexity and the number of engineers working on the project, both of which will, in turn, affect project cost. By tracking project lead times, developers can better predict time to market for current and similar future projects.


### Impact 

Impact measures how much changes to the code affect the overall project. It is also a measurement of how those changes impact the engineers who make them. This is an important metric to measure as code changes can lengthen the product’s time to market, making it costlier. In addition, developers could be dedicating too much time to making certain changes, negatively affecting their productivity and adding to such delays. Therefore, large changes, such as those that involve more code or files, and changes that are more difficult to make have higher impact scores.

### Churn 

Churn is the percentage of time developers spend editing, adding to, or deleting their own code. A high code churn indicates rework and may mean something is wrong in the development process.

### Productivity 

 This measures the amount of each engineer’s efficient code, or code that provides business value. An engineer creating a whole new solution or implementing sweeping code changes will likely deal with lots of trial and error with a low efficiency rate. An engineer who is making a lot of small changes with a low churn rate, however, is likely to have a higher efficiency rate.

### Cycle time 

Cycle time, part of lead time, is how long it takes to make a desired change to the software and put it into production. When a team is using DevOps and employing continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices, they can often measure cycle time in minutes rather than months.

### Open and close rates 

The open and close rate is the number of issues or problems developers report and fix or close over a period of time.


### Down time analysis 

Downtime analysis is a measure of the  mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to recover/repair (MTTR). This evaluates how well software performs in a production environment.
